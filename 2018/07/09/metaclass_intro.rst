Metaclasses made simple
=======================



.. author:: default
.. categories:: none
.. tags:: none
.. comments::

You probably have added the ``__repr__`` method to a Python class:

.. literalinclude:: meta_cats.py
    :pyobject: Cat

This gives a customized representation at the command line:

.. literalinclude:: test_meta_cats.py
    :lines: 3-4
